## Deployment

### Build and Start
- [ ] Set Airflow UID:
  ```bash
  echo "AIRFLOW_UID=$(id -u)" >> .env.production
  ```
- [ ] Create directories:
  ```bash
  mkdir -p backend/logs backend/plugins
  chmod -R 777 backend/logs backend/plugins
  ```
- [ ] Build services:
  ```bash
  docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml --env-file .env.production build
  ```
- [ ] Start services:
  ```bash
  docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml --env-file .env.production up -d
  ```

### Verify Services
- [ ] All containers running:
  ```bash
  docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml ps
  ```
- [ ] Check logs for errors:
  ```bash
  docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml logs
  ```

---

## Post-Deployment Configuration

### Airflow Setup
- [ ] Access Airflow UI at `http://your-server:8081`
- [ ] Login with credentials from `.env.production`
- [ ] Add Variables (Admin â†’ Variables):
  - [ ] `golf_username`
  - [ ] `golf_password`
  - [ ] `kafka_bootstrap_servers` = `kafka:29092`
- [ ] Enable `tee_time_checker_dag`
- [ ] Trigger DAG manually to test

### Verify Each Service
- [ ] Backend API responds:
  ```bash
  curl http://localhost:8000/
  ```
- [ ] Frontend accessible at `http://localhost:3000`
- [ ] Airflow UI accessible at `http://localhost:8081`
- [ ] Database accessible:
  ```bash
  docker exec postgres-prod psql -U airflow -d app -c "\dt"
  ```

### Test Notification System
- [ ] Check notifier logs:
  ```bash
  docker logs tee-time-notifier-prod --tail 50
  ```
- [ ] Verify it found tee times (should show "Found X available tee times")
- [ ] Create a test search in the app
- [ ] Verify email notification received

---

## Security Hardening

### Reverse Proxy (Production)
- [ ] Nginx/Traefik configured as reverse proxy
- [ ] SSL/TLS certificates installed
- [ ] HTTP redirects to HTTPS
- [ ] Security headers configured

### Firewall
- [ ] Close unnecessary ports
- [ ] Only expose 80 (HTTP) and 443 (HTTPS) publicly
- [ ] Internal services (PostgreSQL, Kafka, Airflow) not exposed to internet

### Secrets Management
- [ ] `.env.production` file secured (chmod 600)
- [ ] No secrets committed to Git
- [ ] Secrets rotated if previously exposed

---

## Monitoring Setup

### Log Monitoring
- [ ] Set up log rotation for Docker containers
- [ ] Configure centralized logging (optional: ELK, Loki)

### Health Checks
- [ ] Backend health endpoint monitored
- [ ] Frontend availability monitored
- [ ] Airflow scheduler running check
- [ ] Database connection monitored

### Alerts (Optional)
- [ ] Email alerts for service failures
- [ ] Disk space alerts
- [ ] Memory usage alerts

---

## Backup Strategy

### Initial Backup
- [ ] Create initial database backup:
  ```bash
  docker exec postgres-prod pg_dump -U airflow app | gzip > backup_initial.sql.gz
  ```

### Automated Backups
- [ ] Set up cron job for daily database backups
- [ ] Set up volume backups (postgres-data, kafka-data)
- [ ] Configure backup retention policy
- [ ] Test restore procedure

---

## Documentation

### Team Documentation
- [ ] Document server access credentials (securely)
- [ ] Document deployment process
- [ ] Document rollback procedure
- [ ] Document monitoring dashboards

### User Documentation
- [ ] Update user guide with production URLs
- [ ] Create FAQ for common issues
- [ ] Document support contact information

---

## Final Checks

- [ ] Database queries optimized
- [ ] No memory leaks observed
- [ ] Disk space sufficient

### Recovery Tests
- [ ] Test container restart:
  ```bash
  docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml restart
  ```
- [ ] Verify data persists after restart

- [ ] Verify database growing as expected
- [ ] Respond to user feedback

---

## Post-Go-Live (First Week)

- [ ] Review logs for patterns/issues

- [ ] Update documentation based on learnings
- [ ] Schedule first backup verification
- [ ] Plan first maintenance window

---

## Maintenance Schedule

### Daily

## Rollback Plan

In case of critical issues:

1. [ ] Stop production services:
   ```bash
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml down
   ```
2. [ ] Restore from backup if needed
3. [ ] Switch DNS back to old system (if applicable)
4. [ ] Notify users of service restoration
5. [ ] Investigate and fix issues in staging
6. [ ] Schedule new deployment
